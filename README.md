THIS IS A FILE ABOUT MY PROJECT!
Ecare is a place for all the minority groups like ALS patients to sell their handmade, making them work like normal people, and aware the social attention toward those groups.
This is the source code of the website. We adapt the UX design from Amado Template, we incorporated database for product-detailed, login, and sign-up, and we have cookies, admistrator page, add-item, edit-item, and a lot of other cool functions, which you can find in this file.
Please use Atom, Xcode or other available editors to open this file in order to glance through all the code in all the handlebars, js,etc. file.
